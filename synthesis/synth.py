class Synthesizer():
    """
    This class is has three methods `synth_method_1`, `synth_method_2` or
    `synth_method_3` for generating expression for a program's holes.

    You may also choose to add data attributes and methods to this class
    to enable instances of `Synthesizer` to remember information about
    previous runs.

    Calling `synth_method_1`, `synth_method_2` or `synth_method_3` should
    produce a new set of hole completions at each call for a given
    `Synthesizer` instance.
    For example, suppose the program p contains one hole `h1` with the
    grammar `[ G : int -> G + G | 0 | 1 ]`. Then, the following sequence
    is a possible execution:
    ```
    > s = Synthesizer(p)
    > s.synth_method_1()
    { "h1" : 0 }
    > s.synth_method_1()
    { "h1" : 1 }
    > s.synth_method_1()
    { "h1" : 0 + 1 }
    ...
    ```
    Each call produces a hole completion. The returned object should
    be a mapping from the hole id (its name) to the expression of the
    hole.
    Each `synth_method_..` should implement a different enumeration
    strategy (e.g. depth first, breadth first, constants-first,
    variables-first...).

    **Don't forget that we expect your third method to be the best on
    average!**

    *Hint*: the method `hole_can_use` in the `Program` class returns the
    set of variables that a given hole can use in its completions.
    e.g. `prog.hole_can_use("h1")` returns the variables that "h1" can use.
